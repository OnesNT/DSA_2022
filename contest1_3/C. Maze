Given a maze in the form of binary matrix N x N. Each cell is 1 (you can go to the cell) or 0 (you can't go to the cell). You need to find the shortest path in a maze from given source to destination. Print the shortest path from source to destination.

You can go up, down, left and right. Matrix rows and columns are numbered from 1 to N.




Input format
First line: N (size of matrix) Next N lines: 0s and 1s line by line N-th + 2 line: a b (source point) N-th + 3 line: c d (target point)

Output format
Print the shortest path line point by point. Each point on a single line. Print "-1" if there is no path.
